# Personal SLM Assistant

## 📌 What is an SLM?
An **SLM (Small Language Model)** is a lightweight version of a large language model (LLM).  
Unlike LLMs that require heavy compute and cloud resources, SLMs are optimized to run locally or with minimal resources, making them faster, cost-efficient, and privacy-friendly.  

SLMs can be fine-tuned on personal data, enabling them to act as **personalized assistants** that understand your context better than general-purpose AI models.
